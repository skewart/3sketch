FIXME:
    - params list pushes the code text window down, hiding buttons and much of window - problem for defs with lots of params
    - name of first parameter being placed as default name for newly added params
    - definitions sometimes crash when adjusting params

TODO:
    - Add save to .stl button in display pane
    - Add send to Shapeways button in display pane
    - Add ability to resize the code pane and display pane
    - Rebuild left-side panel to have color gradiant panels that can hide/expand
    - Add error display
    - Position camera in relation to size (bounds) of geometry being visualized - and/or remember it when saving defs
